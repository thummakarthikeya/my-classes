Question 1: Weekend Planner – Spring Core (XML Configuration)
===============================================================
It's Saturday, and your app should print whether it's a weekend or a weekday. You have a DateService class with a method getDayOfWeek() that returns the current day.


How would you configure a Spring Core application using XML, where the DateService bean automatically detects the day, and:

Prints "It's the Weekend!" if it's Saturday or Sunday.

Prints "It's a Weekday." otherwise.
=========================================================================================================================================================================

Question 2: Month-End Reminder – Spring Core (XML Configuration)
====================================================================
You’ve built a bean CalendarService with a method getDate() that returns the current day of the month.

Using Spring Core (XML), write a scenario where:

If it’s the 30th or 31st, print "Month is ending, please submit reports."

Otherwise, print "Continue working as usual."
==============================================================================================================
Question 3: New Year Alert – Spring Core (XML Configuration)
A YearService bean contains a method getMonth() that returns the current month name.

Using Spring XML configuration:

If the month is "January", print "Happy New Year!"

If the month is "December", print "Get ready for the new year!"

For all other months, print "Regular month."
=========================================================================================================================
Question 4: Daily Greeting Scheduler – Spring Core (XML Configuration)
==================================================================
A bean TimeService returns the current hour using getHour().

Based on the system time:

5 AM–11 AM → "Good Morning"

12 PM–4 PM → "Good Afternoon"

5 PM–8 PM → "Good Evening"

Others → "Good Night"

How would you implement this using Spring XML configuration and Java logic without custom input?

Question 5: Weekend Email Scheduler – Spring Core (XML Configuration)
=============================================================================
You have a SchedulerService bean with a method getDay() returning the current day of the week.

How would you configure your application so that:

If it’s "Friday", print "Schedule weekly report email."

If it’s "Monday", print "Check weekend system logs."

Otherwise, print "Normal weekday operations."
