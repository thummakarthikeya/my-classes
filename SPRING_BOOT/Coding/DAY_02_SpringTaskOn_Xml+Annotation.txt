Task 1 — Vehicle Manufacturing & Service Management System
==========================================================
(Hybrid Injection — XML + Annotation + @ComponentScan)

Objective
Demonstrate hybrid dependency injection using constructor and setter injection, combining XML bean definitions and annotation-based wiring with @ComponentScan.
Class-wise Design
1️.Engine

Fields: engineType, horsePower

Constructor: accepts both fields for constructor injection

Method: showEngineDetails()

Injection Type: Constructor Injection via XML

2️.Tyre

Fields: brand, size

Setter methods for each field

Method: showTyreDetails()

Annotations: @Component

Injection Type: Setter Injection via XML properties

3️. Vehicle

Fields: vehicleName, engine, tyre

Constructor: accepts Engine

Setter: setTyre() annotated with @Autowired

Method: displayVehicleInfo()

Injection Type:

Engine → via XML constructor

Tyre → via @Autowired setter

vehicleName → via XML <property>

4️.ServiceCenter

Fields: vehicle, serviceType

@Autowired on Vehicle

Method: performService()

Injection Type:

Vehicle → Annotation (@Autowired)

serviceType → XML property

5️.SpringConfig.xml

<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.vehicle"/>

Beans defined for Engine, Vehicle, Tyre, and ServiceCenter

Enable <context:annotation-config/>

6️.MainApp

Load context → ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("SpringConfig.xml")

Get ServiceCenter bean

Call performService()

Expected Output
----------------
=== Vehicle Manufacturing & Service System ===
Engine Details: Type = Diesel, HorsePower = 180
Tyre Details: Brand = MRF, Size = 18
Vehicle: Toyota Fortuner
Service Type: Full Engine Checkup


Task 2 — Library Information & Management System
Objective
Demonstrate hybrid Spring dependency injection between multiple beans (Book, Author, Library, and Librarian) using both constructor and setter injection, configured via XML and annotations.
Class-wise Design
1️.Author

Fields: authorId, authorName

Constructor for both fields (constructor injection)

Method: displayAuthorInfo()

Injection: Constructor (XML)

2️. Book

Fields: bookId, bookTitle, author

Constructor: accepts bookId, bookTitle

Setter: setAuthor() annotated with @Autowired

Method: displayBookDetails()

Injection:

Author → via @Autowired

bookId, bookTitle → via XML properties

3️.Library

Fields: libraryName, books (List<Book>)

Constructor for both fields (constructor injection)

Method: showLibraryData()

Injection: Constructor Injection (XML with <list> of books)

4️.Librarian

Fields: library, employeeName

Setter: setLibrary() annotated with @Autowired

Method: manageLibrary()

Injection:

Library → Annotation

employeeName → XML property

5️.SpringConfig.xml

Component scan → <context:component-scan base-package="com.example.library"/>

Beans for Author, Book, Library, Librarian

<list> used for book collection injection

<context:annotation-config/>

6. MainApp

Load XML context

Retrieve Librarian bean

Call manageLibrary()

Expected Output
---------------
=== Library Information System ===
Library: City Central Library
Managed By: Mr. John
Books Available:
  - Book: Spring Framework Essentials | Author: Martin Fowler
  - Book: Clean Code | Author: Robert C. Martin


Task 3 — Employee Project Management System

Objective

Showcase a hybrid Spring Core setup with both Constructor and Setter Injection, managing employee-project relations using XML + annotation configuration.
Class-wise Design
1️. Project

Fields: projectId, projectName, duration

Constructor to inject all fields

Method: showProjectDetails()

Injection Type: Constructor (XML)

2️.Employee

Fields: employeeId, employeeName, project

Constructor: accepts employeeId, employeeName

Setter: setProject() with @Autowired

Method: showEmployeeDetails()

Injection Type:

Project → via @Autowired

Employee ID/Name → XML property

3️.Department

Fields: departmentName, employees (List<Employee>)

Constructor Injection: both fields

Method: showDepartmentInfo()

Injection Type: Constructor (XML with <list>)

4. Company

Fields: companyName, departments (Map<String, Department>)

Constructor Injection: all fields injected via XML <map>

Method: showCompanyInfo()

Injection Type: Constructor (XML map injection)

5️.SpringConfig.xml

<context:component-scan base-package="com.example.company"/>

Beans for Project, Employee, Department, and Company

Use <list> for departments → <map> for multiple departments

<context:annotation-config/> enabled

6️.MainApp

Load SpringConfig.xml

Get Company bean

Call showCompanyInfo()

Expected Output
---------------
=== Company Structure ===
Company: TechWave Solutions
Department: IT
  Employee: Alice | Project: Web Application (6 Months)
Department: HR
  Employee: Bob | Project: Recruitment System (3 Months)
