What is a component in React ?
-> it is a building block of page or UI.

A React component is a reusable piece of UI that represents a part of a web page, such as:

A button

A form

A navbar

Or even an entire page (if designed that way)

🧱 Think of it like this:

A page is made up of multiple components.

So the relationship is opposite of what you said.
