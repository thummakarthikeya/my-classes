      from 0 to 255 values. Ex..   h1 {
                                         color: rgb(255,255,0);
                                      }

Fonts : Every font family in the world belong to these any one of these 5 types
        serif: these fount has stroke at corners example times new Roman.
        sans-serif:these founts dont have strokes and these are used in most of the websites Ex: arial, calibri.
        mono-space:these fonts have equal height if letters like a typewriter.
        cursive: These fonts are styled  and curved.
        fantasy-fount: These fonts are used for spectal effects.

How to get founts in websites :
          font-family : it is used to apply fonts to specific element.



       font-size : it is used to change the size of the font.
       font-weight : it is used to change the thickness of the font(100-900/bpld/bolder)
       font-style : it is used to change the style of the font(normal/italic)

         To have the different fount which is not defalult in our vscode then go to ' google founts' we have more than 1000 fonts in it.
        now to use it in css we have to write the 
          -> @import url("google font link ") 
          we can even import  fonts from google using below procedure :
            search "google fonts"---> select a font ----> click 'get font' ---> click 'get embed code' ---> select 'import' and
              copy the code to css

Units: Units are used to measuere the size of elements. Most used units are px(percentage) -- it is used x% of parents size

         vh/vw ----- it is the x$ of viewport(screen) height or viewport width "vh->viewport height" and "vw-> viewport width"
         Ex: if 50vh then that means exact screen 50% 

Background: we can assign a background color or "background-image" to webpage using the following properties .Ex:(background-image: url(''))
       
        ⭐⭐⭐
        background-image: url('')    
        background-repeate: no-repeate;
        background-postion: center;
        background-size: cover;
        background-attachement : auto/scroll/fixed;(it is very important because if we put 'fixed ' the background image 
                                                    will be fixed ifen the the content is motre like wordpress)
        linear-gradients:(orange, yellow); Ex:(background-image:linear-gradients:(orange, yellow));
                                              background-image:linear-gradients:(to top/bottom/left/right orange, yellow);
                                              background-image:linear-gradients:(to top/bottom/left/right rgb(red,orange, yellow));
                                              background-image:linear-gradients:(45deg rgb(red,orange, yellow));
                                              h1{
                                                color:linear-gradients:(45deg rgb(red,orange, yellow));
                                              }
                                              background-image:radial-gradients:(45deg rgb(black,white));(the colors will be in rounds
                                                                        like outer circle will be black and inner circle will be black)


    linear-gradiant: gradients are the transformation of the one color to another . linear graident asigns colirs in straight way.
    background-image: linear-gradient (position, color1 , color2.....) position can ve to left /to right /to bottom/to top /xdeg we can even 
                      assign the gradient(color1,color2);
background-clip: text;----------(only the text will be in gradient)

redial-gradient: it is used to assign gradients circles
