Block vs Inline Elements:
    In Html, elements are classified as two types, block and inline elements
    Block elements are the elements that always takes place in new line. it won't allow any other elements beside them
    div: div is a block container element which is used to combine multiple elements as a group but make the group as block.
    span: span is a inline container element which is used to combine multiple elements as group but make the group as inline

    semantic Elements: These elements are also container elements like div and span but these elements are more understandble to search engines.
    These elements will not make any difference to the UI but it does to the code readability.
    eg: header, footer, nav, aside, main,article,section
