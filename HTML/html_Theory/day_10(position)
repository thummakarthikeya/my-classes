Position: Position is used to keep elements at different places in user interface. There are 5 positions available in css such as
    i. absolute
    ii. relative
    iii. static
    iv. fixed
    v. sticky

 i.  static : By Default , all elements are static. static elements cannot have top,left,right,bottom
 ii. absolute : Absolute Elements move according to the position of body.so, left:0px will actually move towards leftmost end of screen .
 Scrolling have impact on absolute.
 iii. relative : relative Elements move according to the position of current position . so, left:0px will not have impact towards it.
 iv. fixed : fixed Elements also move according to body but it will not scroll
 v. sticky : sticky is nothing but relative+fixed, so initially it stays like relative but once it reaches certain point, it becomes fixed
   until it parent end reached
