Media Queries : Media Queries are used for responsiveness of the website. We can make the styles(css) works for specific widths. eg:
      large devices --- >=1400px
      laptops  --- >=1280px to  <1400px
      desktop ---- >=1080px to <1280px
      tablets ---  >=768px  to <1080px
      mobiles(landscape) ---   >=576px to <768px
      mobiles(portrait)  ---   0 to <576px

BEst Approach for web design is Mobile First Design(MFD)

    @media (min-width:1280px) and (max-width:1400px){
        /* laptops*/
    }


Animations : Animations are used to make an element goes through multiple states. Every Animation contain following properties such as
     Animation-name  : name of the Animation
     Animation-duration : time of the Animation(in seconds)
     Animation-timing-function : controls the speed of animation(ease/ease-in/ease-out/ease-in-out/linear)
     Animation-iteration-count : number of times animation repeats(number or infinite)
     Animation-direction : decides which direction animation should run(normal/reverse/alternate/alternate-reverse)
     Animation-delay : time to delay the animation(in seconds);

We can also use websites like "lottifiles" or "animista" for Animations
