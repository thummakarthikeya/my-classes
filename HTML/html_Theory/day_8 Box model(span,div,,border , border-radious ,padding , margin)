span = we use span instead of div because if we write anything in div it takes to next line so we use span it remains in the same line 


Box model : browser treates every element as a Box . 
            a BOX CONTAINS = i. border
                            ii. border-radious
                           iii. padding 
                            iv.  margin
i.border : border is the surrounding line for the elements 
          "border-top: size shape color;"
          "border-bottom: size shape color;"
          "border: 5px solid Red;"
          "border: size shape color;"

ii. border-radious: it is the corner radious surrounds the border corners. 
          "border-radious:size;"
we can also assign each corner radious seperately.
          "border-radious: 20px;"
          "border-top-left-radious: 20px;"
          "border-right-bottom-radious: 20px;"
the combination of border top and boder-bottom it is very good for perticular text with red colour .
we can even assign border-left , border-right, border-top, border-bottom.


iii. padding: it is the space between border and the actual content of element (inside the element)
    "padding: size;"
    we can also assign padding as padding-left , padding-right, padding-top, padding-bottom etc.
   normally , padding makes each box increase ots height or width because by default all are cintent boxes. so we need to use box-sizing:border-box;
    ⭐⭐⭐box-sizing:border-box;

iv. margin : it is the space outside the border. used for gap between the elements
    'margin:size;'
    we can also assign margin as margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom.
