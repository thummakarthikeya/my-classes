shortcut for link tag is = link:css

->Float: to come image and text content side by side.(float is used to make any 
        element left or right side of screen . it makes the elment remove form
          actual executatoon and next element takes up the space of floation)
Ex: image {
          float: left;  or  float: right;  or  float: none;
          }

we can even clear floating elements for any another element for any other elements using
->clear: right/left/none;
  this is clear the right side part of the content of perticular para or any text if iage etc.





->display:  display is used to arrange the elements in a specific way 
  display: block; will make the elements into block so that each element will display in new line 
  display: incline; -- will maek the elements into inline so that each element follows the previous elements(maintains same flow)
          but inline elements canot handle  height/width/vertical margines
  display: inline-block -- works like inline but accept height/width
  display:none; (removes the element(visibility: hidden just hides the elements))removes the element make the next element to occupy his place.


->visibility:hidden; makes transperant but it will be present there
