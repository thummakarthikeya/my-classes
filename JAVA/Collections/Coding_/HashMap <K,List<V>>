Create a Scenario based program on Course Registration System using HashMap where multiple students can be added in a particular course.
[See the Test cases].

In the HashMap, Course Name will be the HashMap key, where as List<String>
will become HashMap value.

Coding Requirements :
---------------------
Take an ELC class CourseRegistration with main method.

In this main method create one HashMap object which takes Course name(String) as a key and Students name (List<String>) as a value.

Create Scanner class object to perform various operation on CourseRegistration system by using switch case.


--- Course Registration Menu ---
1. Register student to course [use V computeIfAbsent(key, Function<T,R>)]
2. Remove student from course [use V computeIfPresent(key, BiFunction<T,U,R>)]
3. View course-wise student list
4. Exit
Enter your choice:
