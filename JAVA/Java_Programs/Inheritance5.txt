 Student Fee Management System

 A University needs an efficient way to manage and process fees for its students. There are different types of students with varying fee structures. 
   
 The university wants a system to handle the following scenarios:

1) Day Scholars: Students who attend classes daily but do not stay in hostels. They have an additional transport fee with exam fee. This fee needs to be managed and calculated separately.

2) Hostellers: Students who stay in university hostels and have additional hostel fees. Their total fee is the sum of the exam fee and hostel fee.

Coding Requirement :
---------------------
Create a BLC class as Student  

Attributes/Properties: [protected]

studentId : int 
name :String 
examFee:double

Define parameterized constructor to initialized all fields. 

Create two BLC sub classes of Student called DayScholar and Hosteller. 
Add the following implementations to each class.

DayScholar:
-----------

transportFee : double 


Define parameterized constructor to initialized all fields super and sub class. 

Generate the toString() method which will display all fields super and sub class.

Methods: 
  
1) Name of the method :  payFee()
      Access modifier :  public
          return type :  double
            parameter :  double amount
