Features of Java Programming Langauge :
===================================
What are important features of Java ?
=====================================
1) Simple
Java is easy to learn, especially if you know C or C++.
No complex concepts like pointers, multiple inheritance.

2) Object-Oriented
Everything in Java is treated as an object (except primitive types).
Supports encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.

3) Platform Independent
"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA).
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on any machine with JVM.

4) Secure
Provides built-in security like Bytecode Verifier.
Widely used in banking, enterprise apps.

5) Robust
Strong memory management (Garbage Collector).
Exception handling and type checking reduce errors.

6) Portable
Java bytecode can run on any platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).

7) Multithreaded
Supports multithreading for parallel execution.
Useful in gaming, animations, and real-time applications.

8) Distributed
Java can be used to build distributed applications.

9) High Performance
JIT compiler provides high performance.

10) Dynamic
Can load classes dynamically at runtime.
Runtime polymorphism.

11) Interpreted + Compiled
Java programs are first compiled into bytecode (by javac) and then interpreted/executed by JVM.

12) Architecture Neutral
No hardware-dependent features â†’ bytecode works everywhere.
