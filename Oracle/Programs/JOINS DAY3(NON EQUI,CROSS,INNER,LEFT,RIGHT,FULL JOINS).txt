                                       JOINS TASK
                                     ==============

Non Equi Join:-Based on other than equality operator(>,<,>=,<=,<>,between,...)
=============  we can retrieve data from multiple tables. Here also joining
               conditional columns belongs to same data type.In oracle,
               this join is also called as Between.... and Join.



1.Check the following non equi join output

SQL>select * from test3;
 
      deptno
     ---------
        10
        20

SQL>select * from test4;
       
       deptno
     ---------
         10
         20
         30

SQL>select * from 
    test3 , test4
    where test3.deptno>test4.deptno;



NOTE:-in oracle when ever one table columns lies between another table
=====  two columns then also we are retrieving data from those tables
       by using non equi join.

EG:-
===
SQL>select * from emp;
SQL>select * from salgrade;

SQL>select ename,sal,losal,hisal
    from emp , salgrade
    where sal between losal and hisal;


Cross Join:- This join returns the Cartesian product of two tables.
==========

In oracle, we can also retrieve data from multiple tables without 
using join condition .in this case oracle server internally uses default join.
in oracle 8i side default join is cross join. 



SQL>select ename,sal,dname,loc
    from emp,dept;


o/p:56 rows displayed(internally cross join is performed)


2)Write a query to generate all possible combinations of car names and colors, so that 
  each car name appears once with every color. 

SQL>SELECT * FROM CARS;

    CARNAME
   ---------
     BMW
     TOYOTA
     HONDA

SQL>SELECT * FROM COLORS;

    COLOUR
   --------
    RED
    BLUE
    BLACK

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Write a query to display employee details along with the projects assigned to them.
  Display only those employees who are assigned to a project.


SQL>select * from EMPLOYEES1;

EMPID      ENAME 
-----    ---------    
  1        SURYA
  2        KAVYA
  3        ANUSHKA
  4        KIRAN
  5        SUBBARAO



SQL>select * from PROJECTS;


  PID           PNAME                      EMPID
--------     -------------------          --------
  101        SENTIMENT ANALYSIS              3
  102        ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM            
  103        MOBILE APP DEVELOPMENT          2
  104        EMPLOYEE PAYROLL                1
  105        BANK ACCOUNT SYSTEM            




2.Write a query to display all projects and their assigned employees, if any. 
  Including unassigned projects.



3.Write a query to display all employees and all projects.If an employee is not assigned to any     project or a project is not assigned to any employee, display all details



4.Write a query to display all employees and the projects they are working on, if any.
  Including employees not assigned to any project.




5.Write a query to display customer details along with their order details.
  Display only customers who have placed orders.



SQL>SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;

     CUSTOMERID       CUSTOMRNAME
     ----------     ---------------
         1             SURYA
         2             ANUSHKA
         3             KIRAN
         4             KAVYA
         5             GOWTHAM



SQL> SELECT * FROM ORDERS;

    ORDERID    CUSTOMERID    ORDERDATE     TOTAMOUNT
  ----------   ----------   ----------    ----------
       101          1        12-JAN-24        850

       106          2        16-APR-24        1000


6.Write a query to display customers who have not placed any orders.



7.Write a query to display all customers along with their order details, 
  including those customers who have not placed any orders.



8.Write a query to display all orders and their corresponding customer details,
