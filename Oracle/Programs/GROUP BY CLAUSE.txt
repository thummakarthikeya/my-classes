                                ==============


GROUP BY:- Group by clause is used to divide similar data items
=========  into set of logical groups. And also group by clause    
           reduces no of rows in each group.

Syntax:-select columnname.......
======  from tablename 
        group by columnname;

Execution order:-
==============
1.FROM 
2.WHERE
3.GROUP BY 
4.HAVING
5.SELECT
6.ORDER BY


RULE:- Other than group function columns specified after select
=====  then those all columns must be specified after group by.
       Otherwise oracle server returns an error not a GROUP BY 
       expression.

EX1:-
==== 
    SQL>select deptno,job
        from emp
        group by deptno,job;
