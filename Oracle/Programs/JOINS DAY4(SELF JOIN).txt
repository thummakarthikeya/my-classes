                           Self Join
                         ============

Self join:-Joining a table to itself is called self join. Here joining
=========  conditional columns must belongs to same data type.

  Generally in all relational databases self joins are used in
following 2 senarios. These are

1)Compare one table one column any value with all other values
  in same column.

2)Compare 2 different column values(same datatype) in a same table

   Whenever we are using self join then we must create table aliasnames in from clause.
These aliasnames must be different names. These aliasnames internally behaves like
exact tables when query execution time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
*1*Write a query to display the employee names and their manager names
 * from emp table by using self join(V.V.I.M.P)




2.Write a query to display the employees who are reporting to BLAKE as a manager
  from emp table by using self join?




3.Write a query to display the employees who are getting more salary than their
  manager salary from emp table using self join?




4.Write a query to display BLAKE'S manager name from emp table 
  by using self join?




5.Write a query to display the employees who are joining
         before their managers from emp table
                by using self join?




6. Write a query to display the employees who are getting same salary
    as SCOTT salary from emp table using self join?


NOTE:-when we are comparing one column any value with all other values in same column
===== by using self join then we must display data from second alias table only.



7.Describe in these two tables what is o/p of inner join, left outer
   join ,right outer join, full outer join

NOTE:- Guess the output with out executing queries in all cases

SQL>select * from q1;

         SNO
       ------
          1
          2
          3
          4
          5
          6
          8

SQL>select * from q2;

        SNO

8.What is the output when we are performing inner join on the following 
  TEST01,TEST02 Tables.

     1              3
     null           null
     null         
     2
