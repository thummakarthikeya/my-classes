                                JOINS TASK
                              ==============

JOINS:- Joins are used to retrieve data from  
======           multiple tables. 
 

.In all relational databases when we are joining 'n' tables then we must
 use 'n-1' joining conditions.

EQUI JOIN:-Based on equality operator we are retrieving data from multiple tables.
========== Here joining conditional columns must belongs to same datatype.

NOTE:-Always equi join returns matching rows only(Here deptno 40
===== does not display when we are using dept.deptno also)
 

1.Inner join:- This join also returns matching rows only. Here also
=============  joining conditional columns must belongs to same 
               data type. Inner join (9i) performance is very high
               compare to oracle 8i equi join.


NOTE:-Equi join and inner join both are same. if we are interested in inner 
      join write the queries by using inner join.no problem


8i joins or NON ANSI joins syntax:-
=================================
select col1,col2.......
from tablename1 , tablename2
where tablename1.commoncolumnname= tablename2.Commoncolumnname;
      --------------------------------------------------------
                                 ||
                                 ||
                          (join condition)


9i joins or ANSI JOINS syntax:-
==============================

Syntax:-
========
select col1,col2.......
from tablename1 join tablename2
on tablename1.commoncolumnname= tablename2.Commoncolumnname;
   --------------------------------------------------------
                               ||
                               ||
                         (join condition)


USING TABLE ALIASNAMES JOINS:-
=============================
   In all relational databases for improve performance of the joins we can also
use table aliasnames for the tables in from clause.Then those alias names must 
be used in place of tablename with in select list and also with in the 
joining condition.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Write a query to display the employee names and their department names from emp, dept tables.



2.Write a query to display the employee names and their locations from emp, dept tables



3.Write a query to display the employees who are working in the location CHICAGO 
  from emp,dept tables ?

Note: If we want to filter the data after joining condition then we 
===== must use AND operator in 8i joins. where as in 9i joins we are
      using either AND operator or WHERE clause also.



4.Write a query to display no of employees in each location from emp, dept tables 
  by using equi join or inner join?



5.Write a query to display dname, sum(Sal) from emp,dept tables by using 
  equi join or inner join?



6.Write a query to display department name and sum of salaries and whose sum of salaries
  is more than 9000 from emp,dept tables
   


7.Write a query to display BLAKE employee record along with department details
   from emp, dept tables?




8.Write a query to display student names and their corresponding faculty names
  from studentenrollment and faculty tables
