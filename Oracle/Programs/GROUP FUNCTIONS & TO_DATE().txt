SQL>insert into emp(empno,ename,hiredate)values(1,'subbarao',sysdate);

SQL>select * from emp;

SQL>select * from emp where hiredate=sysdate;
                           
                  10-dec-25 10:43:54=10-dec-25 10:43:58(not matching that's why no rows
                                                                                selected)

                            
   no rows selected

insertion time retrieving time is alteast 1 sec also different.To overcome this problem
time portion set to 0 by using trunc().Then date part only comparing then correct result.



SOLUTION:-
=========
SQL>select * from emp where trunc(hiredate)=trunc(sysdate)
