Ques - 1
--------------
A Strong Number is a number in which the sum of the factorial of its digits equals the number itself.

Example:

145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145 
2 = 2! = 2 

40585 = 4! + 0! + 5! + 8! + 5! = 40585
Check the given number is strong number or not by using nested while loop.
Example : 
Input as : 145
Output as : 145 is a strong number.

Example : 
Input as : 125
Output : 125 is not a strong number.


Ques - 2
---------------
Find All Palindrome Numbers in a Range  by using nested for loop and while loops.
Problem: Print all palindrome numbers between 1 and 1000.

Outer for → pick each number in range
Inner for → reverse digits

Example Output:
1 2 3 ... 121 131 ... 999

Ques - 3
-----------------
Find Prime Numbers in a Range  by using nested for loop.

Problem: Write a program to print all prime numbers between 1 and 50 using nested for loops.
Outer for → goes through numbers 1 to 50
Inner for → checks if a number is prime

Example Output:
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47

Ques - 4
-------------------
Print All Perfect Numbers in a Range by using nested for loops.

Problem: A perfect number is one where the sum of divisors (excluding itself) equals the number.
Write a program to find all perfect numbers between 1 and 1000.

Outer for → numbers 1 to 1000
Inner for → sum divisors

Example Output:
6 28 496
