A restaurant wants to build a simple program that helps customers order their meals based on a menu selection. The menu has the following options:

1. Pizza - $10
2. Burger - $7
3. Pasta - $8
4. Salad - $5
5. Exit

The user needs to select an item by entering the corresponding number (1-5) and also need to enter the number of quantities they want to order.
If the user selects an invalid option, they should be notified.
