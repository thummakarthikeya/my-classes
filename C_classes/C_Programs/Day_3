Que 1 : Write a 'C' program to take the marks of a student in 5 subjects as input and determine how many subjects have marks greater than or equal to 35 and how many have marks less than 35. 
------- The program should not use any control statements (if, else, switch, etc.) or the ternary operator. 

Sample input  : int sub1 = 38, sub2 = 34, sub3 = 35, sub4 = 78, sub5 = 20

Sample Output : Pass in 3 subject and fail in 2 subject.

Que 2 :  A shopkeeper buys a TV set for Rs. 3500 and sells it at a profit of 27%. Apart from this a VAT of 12.7% and Service Charge is 3.87% is charged. 
-------  Write a C program to Display total selling price, profit along with vat and service charge.
         To calculate the selling price, profit, VAT, and service charge, follow these steps:

         1) Calculate the selling price:

            Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit

            Selling Price = Rs. 3500 + (27% of Rs. 3500)


         2) Calculate the profit:

            Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price


         3) Calculate VAT:

            VAT = 12.7% of Selling Price


         4) Calculate Service Charge:

            Service Charge = 3.87% of Selling Price



ans::

// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    float cost_price, selling_price;
    
    cost_price = 3500;
    float profit =cost_price*27/100;
    float vat =cost_price*12.7/100 ;
    float service =cost_price*3.87/100 ;
    float SellingPrice  = cost_price+profit+vat+service;
    printf("profit Add to cost- Price = %.2f\n",profit);
    printf("vat Price = %.2f\n",vat);
    printf("Service Price = %.2f\n",service);
    printf("TotalSelling price = %.2f\n",SellingPrice);
    
    profit=SellingPrice-cost_price;
    printf("totalProfit = %.2f",profit);
    
    return 0;
}

   Ques - 3
---------------------  
 Write a 'C' program to check and print that given number is even or odd without using ternary operator and control statments.
--------

Sample input : int a = 10
Sample Output : EVEN

Sample input : int a = 125
Sample Output : ODD


Que 4 :  Write a 'C' program to check and print the Maximum number among two numbers without using ternary operator and control statments.
--------

Sample input : int a = 10 , b = 20
Sample Output : MAX = 20


// Online C compiler to run C program online
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a=10;
    int b=20;
