ServiceCenter

[Title: Vehicle Service Center Management System Using nested else-if ladder]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write a C program for a service center by following the given rules and guidelines.

This service center only accepts 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, and 4-wheelers. If any other vehicle comes to you, you must display a message: "This service center does not accept vehicles other than 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, and 4-wheelers."

If the vehicle is a 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, or 4-wheeler, you should ask the user what the age of the vehicle is.

If the age of the vehicle is above 8 months, only then will you accept the service; otherwise, you must show a message: "Your vehicle service will be done after a while."

If the vehicle's age is greater than 8 months, display options to the user on the console.

Options :-
----------
-> Enter 1 for a tire problem
-> Enter 2 for a fuel problem
-> Enter 3 for an engine issue
-> Enter 4 for general services

If the user enters 1 as input for a tire problem, you should display the message: "How many tires are you facing issues with?" Based on the number of tires, generate the bill.

For example, if the tire cost is Rs. 400, and the user provides 3 tires, the bill should be generated as Rs. 1200 in the format below.

Bill Format :-
---------------
-> Name of the owner

-> Name of the bike

-> Issue

-> Bill
--------
For fuel problems, the cost is Rs. 1500.
