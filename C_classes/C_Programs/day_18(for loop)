Q1. Fibonacci Series
Question:
Print the first N Fibonacci numbers using a for loop.
Example:
Input: N=7
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8

Q2.  Check Perfect Number
Question:
A number is Perfect if the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) equals the number.
Write a program to check if a number is perfect.

Example:
Input: 28 → Divisors (1+2+4+7+14=28) → Perfect Number



Q3.  Print Multiples of a Number

Print the first N multiples of a number.
Example:
Input: x = 7, N = 5 → Output: 7 14 21 28 35

Q4. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Find GCD of two numbers using a for loop.

Example:
Input: 12, 18 → GCD = 6


Q5. Power of a Number

Find x^y using a for loop.
Example:
Input: x=2, y=5 → Output: 32


Q6. Sum of an Arithmetic Progression (AP)

Find sum of first N terms of AP.
Example:
Input: a=2, d=3, N=5 → Sequence: 2 5 8 11 14 → Sum=40

Q7. Question: LCM of Two Numbers using for Loop in C
Problem Statement:
Write a program in C to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given numbers using a for loop. The program should take two integers as input and print their LCM.
Example 1:
Input:
num1 = 12  
num2 = 18

Output:

LCM of 12 and 18 = 36
 Example 2:

Input:
num1 = 5  
num2 = 7

Output:
LCM of 5 and 7 = 35

Example 3:
Input:
num1 = 15  
num2 = 20

Output:
LCM of 15 and 20 = 60
